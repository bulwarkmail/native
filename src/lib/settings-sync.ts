// Settings kept in an account's Inbox metadata (Stalwart 1.0.0 and later), so
// every device signed in to the account has the same ones (#117; the format
// is in docs/settings-sync.md). They are in the private set of namespaces,
// which only the account's own user reads: not a delegate who has the Inbox
// shared with them.
//
// Where a setting lives, under its webmail name:
// - a plain value (boolean, number, string, null) is a member of one of
//   eight shard entries, `org.bulwarkmail.settings.shard.<0-7>`, picked by a
//   hash of the name: `{ "<name>": { "v": <value>, "at": <ms> } }`;
// - a list or a map has an entry of its own,
//   `org.bulwarkmail.settings.value.<name-in-kebab-case>`:
//   `{ "k": "<name>", "v": <value>, "at": <ms> }`, so one long list can't
//   crowd other settings out of an entry (8 KB each, 16 KB in all).
// `at` is when the setting was last changed, on the clock of the device that
// changed it. Without `v` the setting was put back to its default at `at`.
// The newest change wins, setting by setting; a list or a map is replaced
// whole. A member is written on its own, so two devices changing different
// settings don't undo each other.
//
// Pure: reading the entries and planning how this device's settings and the
// account's come together. stores/settings-sync-store does the requests.
